# ðŸŽ¥ Movie-Recommender

This project implements a **Collaborative Filtering-based Recommendation System** using the MovieLens dataset. It preprocesses the data, applies normalization and feature engineering, and builds a recommender system to suggest movies based on user preferences.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

### Preprocessing
- **Import libraries and load datasets.**
- **Genre Encoding:** Split and encode genres using one-hot encoding.
- **Rating Normalization:** Normalize ratings and convert timestamps to datetime.
- **Data Filtering:** Filter out movies with insufficient ratings.

### Model Building
- Create user-item interaction matrices.
- Apply **collaborative filtering techniques** using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### Evaluation
- Compute **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** for validation.
- Recommend movies to users based on predicted ratings.
